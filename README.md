# p04-Capstone 
##### FYI code doesn't work but still turning it in for the work that i did. was supposed to output a regular shape with between triangle & octogan, with a specifed color, on a specified background color, with a specified size. had it that the shape showed up but were wrong shape so but when i edited it all the shape disapeared so eh?
## input / output
-----------------
### input/ output is used in main.cpp lines[28-55](/main.cpp#L28), [70-97](/main.cpp#L70), and [101-168](/main.cpp#L101)
#### i used output to prompt for answers which i recived with imput to use those values in the function.
-----------------
## Control Flow
----------------
### control flow is used practically everywhere starting at main.cpp line [32](/main.cpp#L32), and shape.cpp line [104](/shape.cpp#L104)
#### I used control flow to change the outcome of a situation based on the variable imput by the user.
----------------
## Iteration 
-------------------
### Iteration is used nearly everywhere aswell on main.cpp lines [25-55](/main.cpp#L25) [58-61](/main.cpp#L58) [75-83](/main.cpp#L75) [87-95](/main.cpp#L87) [107-172](/main.cpp#L107) & shape.cpp lines [63-72](/shape.cpp#L63) [93-99](/shape.cpp#L93) [127-341](/shape.cpp#L127)
#### this demonstrates use and knowledge of loops used as do whiles, and fors. do whiles to continously promt a user till answer is sufficent and fors to do something a certain amount of times or traverse a vector.
----------------
## Array
----------------
### Arrays are used on main.cpp lines [58-67](/main.cpp#L58) and shape.cpp lines [102-341](/shape.cpp#L102)
#### 2d vectors were used to represnt images and were attempted to be used to draw shapes.
-----------------
## Functions
----------------
### Functions were used on shape.cpp lines[3-50](/shape.cpp#L3) & main.cpp lines [70-174](/main.cpp#L70)
#### functions were used to create and changed values of the object shape and for reciving imputs from the user.
--------------
## File i/o
--------------
### N/A
--------------
## Class
------------------
### used the class [shape.h](/shape.h#L1)
#### class used to make shape.
